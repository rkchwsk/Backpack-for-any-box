# Backpack for any box
 Printables for backpack for any box


**Abstract**

Being exhausted from constantly moving boxes every time I relocate, I designed a backpack capable of carrying any box. It secures the box with two ratchets. The only image on the mood board was that of Sam Porter Bridges, even though I never had the chance to play Death Stranding, and I didnâ€™t intend to turn this project into a cosplay.

THIS IS ALPHA VERSION!!! The design is bad, and does not work properly. All the issues are listed in the Issues section, please read carefully and print at your own risk!

At the moment backpack is somewhat functional for small (<40x40x40 cm) and light (< 3kg) boxes.

- **Issues**

        **Major:**
        
        - The ropes fail to secure the box adequately in the direction perpendicular to the user's back. This occurs due to the length of the ropes and the force direction, which is almost perpendicular to the tensioned direction of the rope.
        - The ropes do not sufficiently secure the box in the horizontal left-right direction. This is because there is nothing preventing the ropes from moving in this direction, regardless of how tightly they are tensioned.
        - The bottom plate is too narrow, resulting in box tilting.
        - The moving rails in the back lack sufficient strength.
        - The M8x50 hex socket cap screws used to hold the ratchets do not have proper locking mechanisms. They are simply screwed into plastic parts and have to function as an axis for the ratchet, leading to potential issues of tightening or loosening.
        - Assembling requires gluing, drilling, and sewing.
        
        **Minor:**
        
        - Too much friction occurs when tightening the ropes.
        - The slots for attaching straps and pads, especially in the top section, are inconvenient.
        - All four box-fixating parts tend to misalign, especially those closer to the back. This is due to the location of the rope guides.
        - The ratchet lock mechanism, especially the pin covers, is not strong enough.
        - I donâ€™t have a standard guide to assemble this. I used screws, glue, tape, and drilled a couple of holes.
        - Standard bolts can be either a bit too short or too long for some places. For example, I use M5x35 hidden bolts for the bottom hinge and back top parts, and they are 1mm longer than needed. ðŸ¤¡
- **Assembling essentials**
    
    What you gonna need:
    
    - aluminum ÐŸ-shaped profile 10x10x1.5 mm
        - ~250mm 10 pieces (6 for front frames, 4 for internal rails in the back)
        - ~80mm 4 pieces (front frames top)
        - ~50mm 4 pieces (front frames sides)
    - aluminum ÐŸ-shaped profile 20x20x2 mm
        - ~350mm 2 pieces (back)
        - ~50-80mm 2 pieces (bottom)
    - Screws
        - M5x35 hidden bolts 12 pieces
        - M8x50 hex socket cap screws
    - Some small screws 3x6 mm ~20 pieces. I used them to attach pin covers and to assemble box fixating pars
    - Soft pads for the back
    - Straps
    
    Everything assembles quite straight. If you feel that some parts require additional drilling, you are probably right. If you sense that some parts are held together by magic, it's probably superglue time.
    
    For the back pads, I used three layers of 20mm foam glued together and concealed in simple Cordura square pockets. I attach them to the backpack using straps and the middle holes in the top and bottom plates of the back
    
- **Future plans & project discord**
    
    I will have a chance to review the design in Febuary. 
    
    But there were several makers who wanted to develop their own version. I will create a discord server to communicate about this project as soon as my account will be restored. For now you can drop me a line any convenient way, contacts below:)
